A.C.E.S. has been tasked with designing a
security camera that will survey an entire
parking lot and be capable of identifying and
producing an image of a car as well as the
license plate in multiple different conditions.

This repository contains the firmware and software for the FPGA, Arduino, and GUI components of our system.
